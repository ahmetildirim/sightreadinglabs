                        <p>
                            <strong>Sight Reading Labs</strong> is a free piano sight-reading practice
                            app built for beginners. As a new piano student, I struggled to find a
                            sight-reading tool that truly supported beginners. Most apps felt either
                            too complex or not focused enough on consistent practice. So I built a
                            simple, focused app designed to make daily sight-reading practice easier
                            and more effective.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The app is intentionally minimal. It&apos;s currently in active
                            development, and new features will be added gradually based on real user
                            feedback and practical needs.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            For now, everything works offline. There are no accounts, no profiles,
                            and no cloud storage and all data stays on your device. The app is
                            completely free to use, with no ads and no in-app purchases.
                        </p>
